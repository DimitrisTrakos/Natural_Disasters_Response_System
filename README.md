# Natural Disaster Response System ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ 

This project simulates the response to natural disasters, specifically the spread of fire in a forested area. The program uses a **multi-agent** system (simulated using Jade and Java) to model the spread of fire, the layout of the forest, and various utils functions to manage forest and fire behavior.

## Project Overview

This project simulates the spread of fire in a forest grid, considering forest clusters and random fire ignition points. It aims to demonstrate how fire can spread over time in a random forest environment.

The program:

- **Generates a forest** with trees placed randomly or in clusters.
- **Simulates fire** that spreads over the forest grid, affecting neighboring forest cells.
- Uses utils classes to manage the forest grid and fire behavior.
